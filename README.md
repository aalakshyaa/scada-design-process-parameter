# scada-design-for-process-parameter
The “Scada Design for Process Parameter” focuses on the design and development of an integrated process control and monitoring system based on PLC and SCADA technologies. This Design serves as a simulation model for industrial automation processes, particularly relevant to chemical, water treatment, and agricultural applications. It incorporates real-time monitoring and control of key process parameters such as flow, level, temperature, and pressure using intelligent sensors and actuators. By leveraging advanced control strategies like cascade, feedforward, and PID control, the system ensures precise and efficient operation of process units.<br />
The implementation of this kit addresses the growing need for smart monitoring solutions in industries where maintaining critical parameters is essential for productivity and safety. With the increasing demand for automated and remote-controlled systems, the Scada Design for Process Parameter offers a scalable and reliable solution for educational and industrial training purposes. It is particularly beneficial in detecting abnormal variations and faults such as overpressure, overflow, under-level conditions, and flow anomalies, thereby preventing equipment damage and improving system performance.
